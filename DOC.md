DOC App Structure Overview

This section provides an overview of the application structure, including the GitHub workflows and the organization of the application code.

GitHub Workflows

	•	checks.yml: Automates the process of logging into Docker Hub, and runs commands to test and lint the application using GitHub Actions.
	•	docker-compose.yml: Contains commands, environment variables, and port configurations for the application.
	•	Dockerfile: Specifies the operating system requirements and installation steps for the application.
	•	requirements.dev.txt: Lists the libraries used for development purposes.
	•	requirements.txt: Lists the libraries required by the application in the production environment.

App Structure

/app

	•	settings.py: Contains all the application configurations, including database settings, middleware, installed apps, and more.
	•	tests.py: File dedicated to unit and integration tests for the application.

/core

	•	management/wait_for_db.py: A utility that ensures PostgreSQL is ready before Docker Compose builds the application, addressing timing discrepancies.
	•	migrations/: This directory contains database migrations generated by the makemigrations command in Django. To apply these changes, follow these steps:
	1.	Ensure the database interface is configured in settings.py.
	2.	Define models and migrations appropriately for the project.
	3.	Run the migrate command to apply the migrations.
	•	models.py: Defines the data models; each class represents a database table, with class attributes mapping to the table columns.
	•	templates/: Directory where all HTML files are stored.
	•	tests/: Contains unit tests created to validate the application functions.

/licao (Lesson)

	•	serializers.py: Responsible for converting lesson-related model data into formats suitable for API requests and responses. Key functions include:
	1.	Data Conversion: Transforms model data into JSON or other formats for API consumption and converts incoming data into usable Python objects.
	2.	Data Validation: Implements custom validations to ensure received data is correctly formatted before saving it to the database.
	3.	Basic Structure: A serializer typically inherits from serializers.ModelSerializer or serializers.Serializer, specifying which fields to serialize.
	•	views.py: Handles HTTP requests related to lessons, returning appropriate responses. It defines the logic for processing client requests made to specific URLs in the application.

/user

	•	Follows the same structure and logic as the lesson module.

manage.py

	•	The main entry point for running the entire application, executed through commands defined in docker-compose.

.dockerignore

	•	Specifies files and directories (like virtual environments) that should be ignored when building Docker images.

Admin Access

	•	Admin Login URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login/?next=/admin/
	•	Login: admin@gmail.com
	•	Password: ssssss
